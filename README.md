# Week03-Assignment
This project is an interactive incremental game inspired by classic “idle” or “clicker” mechanics. Players start with a basic action that generates a resource, and can then spend that resource on upgrades to increase their production rate. The goal is to create an engaging, responsive game that updates dynamically based and progresses over time.
